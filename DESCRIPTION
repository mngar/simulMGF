Description: Simulate a random SNP Matrix for diploid organisms (coded by 0, 1, 2) or half sib/full sib SNP matrix from real or simulated parents SNP data.    Simulate phenotypic traits for real or simulated SNP data, controlled by a specific number of quantitative trait loci  and their effects, sampled from a Normal or a Uniform distributions.    This is useful for testing association studies an genomic prediction models or for educational purposes.
